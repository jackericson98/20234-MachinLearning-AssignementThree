# Machine Learning Assignment Three

### Class - CSC 2850 - Georgia State University
### Name - John Ericson
### Date - 03/27/23


## Overview

In this assignment we looked at three different kernal types for a support vector machine. The kernals used were:

1. **Linear**
2. **Polynomial**
3. **Radial Basis Function - RBF**

Along with each of the kernals three folds were used and each of these folds was trained on a learning curve estimator. In total there were 9 models created, each of which cross validated with a 3-fold stratified k-fold. 

## Usage

To run the code for this assignement, the [chess dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess) will need to be downloaded from kaggle. Next, the Assignment3_ML.ipynb file will need to be run from Google Colab (preferred) or jupyter notebook. 

### Dependencies

1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. pandas
4. sklearn
5. seaborn

## Results

It takes a lot longer than I expected to run these models. I was unable to finish running any of the models in time.
